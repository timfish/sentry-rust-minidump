# `sentry-rust-minidump` 

![Master branch integration test status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/timfish/sentry-rust-minidump/test.yml?label=Integration%20Tests&style=for-the-badge)

Uses the [`minidumper-child`](https://github.com/timfish/minidumper-child) crate
to capture minidumps from a separate process and sends them to Sentry as
attachments via the Sentry Rust SDK. 

`sentry_rust_minidump::init` starts the current executable again with an argument that
causes it to start in crash reporter mode. In this mode it waits for minidump
notification from the main app process and handles writing and sending of the
minidump file as an attachment to Sentry.

Everything before `sentry_rust_minidump::init` is called in both the main and
crash reporter processes and should configure and start Sentry. Everything
after `sentry_rust_minidump::init` is only called in the main process to run
your application code.

```toml
[dependencies]
sentry = "0.32"
sentry-rust-minidump = "0.7"
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let client = sentry::init("__YOUR_DSN__");

    // Everything before here runs in both app and crash reporter processes
    let _guard = sentry_rust_minidump::init(&client);
    // Everything after here runs in only the app process

    App::run();

    // This will cause a minidump to be sent to Sentry 
    #[allow(deref_nullptr)]
    unsafe {
        *std::ptr::null_mut() = true;
    }
}
```

## `ipc` feature

By default there is no scope synchronisation from the app process to the crash
reporter process. This means that native crash event will be missing
breadcrumbs, user, tags or extra added to the scope in the app.  

When the `ipc` feature is enabled, you can send scope updates to the crash
reporter process:

```rust
fn main() {
    let client = sentry::init("__YOUR_DSN__");

    // Everything before here runs in both app and crash reporter processes
    let crash_reporter = sentry_rust_minidump::init(&client).expect("crash reported didn't start");
    // Everything after here runs in only the app process

    crash_reporter.add_breadcrumb(...);
    crash_reporter.set_user(...);
    crash_reporter.set_extra(...);
    crash_reporter.set_tag(...);

    // Don't drop crash_reporter or the reporter process will close!
}
```
